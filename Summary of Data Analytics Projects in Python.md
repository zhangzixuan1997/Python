## Python Programming and Prescriptive Analytics Projects

###  **Big Projects**

1. **Customer Data Crawler and Prescriptive Analytics with SciPy package.** For work reason, the code cannot be shared. During my work at 3Trees, I scraped customer data with BeautifulSoup, urllib, re, xlwt and MySQL; launched data analytics program over store-level data and applied SCAN-PRO model with regression. I utilized Python SciPy and Pandas packages for ROMI sensitivity analysis and operational research to maximum cost reduction.
2. **Python data manipulation and Prescriptive Analytics.** For work reason, the code cannot be shared. During my work at BCG, I was responsible for importing, exporting, manipulating data (data cleaning and basic visualization) with Python. Further Excel data were generated by Python for consulting purposes.
3. [**Python Scraping Movie Data.**](https://github.com/zhangzixuan1997/Crawler_with_Python) Scraped data from Douban with BeautifulSoup, urllib, re, xlwt and sqlite3. Procedure: build get data functions with RegEx, get the URL by manipulating log in information for anti-crawler, and build save data function to export the data to SQLite database and Excel.
